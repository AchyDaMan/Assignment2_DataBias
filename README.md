# Assignment2_DataBias
This project was to use the Perspective API to analyze commment toxicity using google-made Machine learning models to predict what a certain comment would make someone feel.
This score is assingned on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 being the most and 0 being the least.
We were also provided with a set of comments that had been manually assigned a score to compare against the model to see where it would fall short.
